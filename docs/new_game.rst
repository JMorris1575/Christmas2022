The St. Nicholas Game
#####################

I'm planning to add a new game to the website for Christmas 2022, a game involving helping St. Nicholas deliver bags of
gold to poor families. The details of the game design will probably come to me gradually during the year and especially
as I work my way through similar tutorials. This document will serve as a place where I can jot down my ideas as they
come to me.

Topdown Shooter Tutorial

I am currently (Starting in December 2021) working through the Topdown Shooter tutorial at:

and it has already given me a few ideas.

The St. Nicholas Sprite
=======================

The Kenney topdown shooter character spritesheet had a character I thought I could modify with GIMP to become a sprite
for the St. Nicholas character. This is how it looks now:

Node Based ?????
================

I'm learning more about how to connect different nodes of my tree, a problem I had when writing the Concentration
program. I believe it is section seven or eight of the tutorial that talks about something he calls "node injection"
where a higher level node sends a reference to itself to the nodes that might need it. That way, if the hierarchy
changes, the new information gets sent automatically and I don't have to try to find all the references to it.
