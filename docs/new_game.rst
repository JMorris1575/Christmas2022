The St. Nicholas Game
#####################

I'm planning to add a new game to the website for Christmas 2022, a game involving helping St. Nicholas deliver bags of
gold to poor families. The details of the game design will probably come to me gradually during the year and especially
as I work my way through similar tutorials. This document will serve as a place where I can jot down my ideas as they
come to me.

The St. Nicholas Sprite
=======================

The Kenney topdown shooter character spritesheet had a character I thought I could modify with GIMP to become a sprite
for the St. Nicholas character. This is how it looks now:
