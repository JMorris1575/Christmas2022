St. Nicholas Adventure Game Design
##################################

I begin this document on February 17, 2022, after spending some time on the initial development of the game. That has
given me some ideas of what can happen in the game but it will be good to more carefully consider the design of the game
rather than using a haphazard approach. It might help to follow the examples given in the *Discovering Godot* course on
Udemy, such as the one here: https://www.udemy.com/course/draft/1647296/learn/lecture/17264110#overview. He recommends
thinking in terms of the "Essential Experience" of the game and some "Gameplay Factors." I will attempt to follow that
format here.

Overview of the Design
**********************

The Essential Experience
========================

We play the part of Saint Nicholas giving gifts to the poor using both skill and intelligence to complete the task while
remaining undetected and unimpeded by thieves or other things that could foil his plans.

Here are some key factors from this basic idea:

#. We are positive, gift-giving, people.
#. Yet there are challenges we have to face requiring the use of both skill and intelligence.
#. We don't want to be detected by anyone.
#. We have to avoid thieves and other, currently unspecified, things (such as animals) that could foil our plans.

Gameplay Factors
================

Here are some gameplay factors:

#. It is a topdown game.
#. There will be several levels, increasing in difficulty.
#. There can be a tutorial level or the first level could be the tutorial.
#. Skill is required in:

   A. Finding the places where gifts are to be given
   #. Some places may be difficult to find in the maze requiring such things as finding a bridge to cross a river or
      following some convoluted path to arrive at a readily visible target.
   #. Some target locations may require special techniques such as:

      a. Bouncing gold bags off walls
      #. Opening shuttered windows
      #. Getting obstacles to move in order to clear the path to a target -- horses, carts, other things

   #. Never giving a gift when one can be seen doing so
   #. Avoiding thieves who might steal gifts before they are given
   #. Avoiding having gifts lost to animals who find them on the ground

#. Intelligence is required in:

   #. Finding out how to move things or get them to move
   #. Finding things needed to accomplish the task at hand -- keys to unlock, incentives for animals to move, etc.
   #. Learning how to avoid thieves and onlookers.
