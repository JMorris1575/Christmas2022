Concentration Updates
#####################

Having finally gotten the Concentration game to work at the last minute I look forward to making improvements on it
during the year. Here are some ideas:

#. Improve the interaction between the Concentration Godot Game and the Christmas website.

   A. Create a Concentration Model to hold the data on the website.
   #. Use get and post requests, if possible, to pass information back and forth.

#. Improve the Godot game itself -- I'm seeing some ways to improve it by going over jmbiv's Topdown Shooter tutorial.

In order to make these improvements I will copy the Godot ``Christmas Concentration`` project to ``Christmas``
``Concentration 22`` and make all changes there.
